		<p>Welcome to our crowdsourcing experiment on categorizing and describing nouns! <br/>We are interested in organizing people’s everyday commonsense knowledge about objects and nouns prevalent in communication in the English language. </p>
		<hr>
		<h4><b>Task Brief:</b></h4>
		<p>You will be presented with a noun and context sentences, and be asked to:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>Iteratively choose relevant categories for the noun (such as whether a noun is "LIVING" vs "NONLIVING"  or "REAL" vs "ABSTRACT", etc)</li>
		<li>Choose a representative group / "kind" that best relates to the noun (such as a knife being a "MAN MADE OBJECT" or a tiger being a "MAMMAL")</li>
		<li>Fill in layman’s descriptions or attributes for the noun (such as a "tiger" has 4 legs, is found in the wild, etc or "time" can be measured by a clock/watch, signifies passing of events, etc)</li>
		</ol>
		<p><b> We estimate that the task should take you about 10 minutes to complete.</b></p>
